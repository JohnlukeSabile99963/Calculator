# Mass-Transit-System-Grader-NJTransit
This algorithm extracts information from real-time NYC/NJ-based mass transit updates and adds the update containing certain strings to a list. This list is called “Cancelled Trains." The system grader starts at a grade of ‘A’ and drops incrementally toward 'C' or 'F' after a certain number of trains is added to the list.
